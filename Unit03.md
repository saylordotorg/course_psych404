**Unit 3: Existential Therapy** <span id="3"></span> 
*Existential theory grew out of the existential philosophy movement.
This model views mental disorders as problems relating to the basic
condition of human existence. This may sound vague and daunting, but the
approach is generally used only to treat problems that individuals have
with creating meaning, assuming responsibility, and handling freedom or
choice. While not highly favored in the United States, where other forms
of therapy (like psychoanalytic therapy) are more popular, existential
therapy is often practiced in Europe. This unit will discuss the tenets
of existential philosophy and explain how practitioners derive therapy
approaches from them in order to treat mental disorders.*
