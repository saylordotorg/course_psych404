Psychotherapy refers to the practices clinical psychologists use to
treat mental disorders. While “therapy” can denote any intervention
undertaken with the goal of healing someone (including medicinal
treatments for physical problems), psychotherapy is specific in that it
uses certain cognitive, behavioral, and emotional regulation techniques.
Based on pop culture portrayals of psychotherapy, you may be imagining a
patient lying on a couch, talking freely about whatever is on his or her
mind, while a doctor scribbles notes. While there is some truth to this
portrait, it is an obvious oversimplification. Psychotherapy often
involves a pre-defined set of techniques that a counselor will use in
order to solve the problems that his patient is encountering. These
techniques often vary from therapist to therapist and depend on which
school of thought the therapist subscribes to, that is, which
perspectives he or she has adopted in order to explain the causes of and
appropriate treatments for various disorders. For example, therapists
from the schools of Psychoanalysis and Behaviorism will differ greatly
in terms of how they approach and treat an individual suffering from
anxiety. We will spend a substantial amount of time addressing each of
these schools of thought, acknowledging that each has its own strengths
and weaknesses. Psychotherapeutic treatments will also vary based on the
nature of the patient’s disorder. While it may seem obvious that a
therapist will treat Schizophrenia differently than he would Depression,
it should be noted that different mood disorders are treated
differently. We will discuss various approaches to these disorders,
familiarizing ourselves with the theories that support their practice.
You should also be aware that while a therapist may recommend a
particular treatment, it is often the patient that has the final say in
how he will be treated. Therapy is, after all, a personal process for
both the patient and clinician. This course will provide you with an
introduction to the theories, styles, and methods of psychotherapy that
you would need to know in a clinical situation. Feel free to look back
on [PSYCH304](/courses/psych304/) (“Clinical Psychology”) as it will
help remind you of the mental disorders referenced in this course.

course and its requirements.

**Course Designer**: Helena (Mimi) Martin

**Primary Resources**: This course is composed of a range of different
free, online materials. However, the course makes primary use of the
following materials:

-   PubMed Central (provides open access to a variety of journals in the
    area of science/psychology)
-   Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy
-   Lerner’s TV’s version of University of Houston: Dr. Richard
    Kasschau’s Lecture Series *Introduction to Cognitive Psychology *

**Requirements for Completion**: In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials.
You will also need to complete a final exam.

In order to “pass” this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher on
the Final Exam. Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as you
complete it. If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.

**Time Commitment**: This course should take you a total of **86 hours**
to complete. Each unit includes a “time advisory” that lists the amount
of time you are expected to spend on each subunit. These should help you
plan your time accordingly. It may be useful to take a look at these
time advisories and to determine how much time you have over the next
few weeks to complete each unit, and then to set goals for yourself. For
example, Unit 1 should take you 11 hours. Perhaps you can sit down with
your calendar and decide to progress through/complete subunits 1.1  and
1.2 (a total of 6 hours) on Monday/Tuesday night; subunit 1.3 (a total
of 5 hours) on Wednesday/Thursday night; etc.
