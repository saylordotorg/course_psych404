**Unit 4: Client-Centered Therapy** <span id="4"></span> 
*Client-Centered Therapy (also known as person-centered therapy)
developed as a reaction to the “colder” psychoanalytic therapy models.
While the psychoanalytic approach views the therapist as a guide to the
patient, client-centered therapy empowers the patient to take a more
prominent role in his/her treatment by having him use the therapeutic
relationship in order to realize his potential and solve his own
problems. Accordingly, client-centered therapy sees the therapist as a
nurturer, encouraging the patient to develop certain skills while
allowing him to come to his own decisions. Practitioners see this as an
important distinction from psychoanalytic models, where a patient is led
to accept the decision the therapist has made for him. In this unit, we
will review different aspects of client-centered theory, exploring its
differences from psychoanalysis in order to identify the different
clinical applications that result.*
