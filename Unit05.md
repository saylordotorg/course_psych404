**Unit 5: Behavioral Therapy** <span id="5"></span> 
*Behavioral therapy grew out of the behaviorist movement of the 1950s.
According to the principles of behaviorism, all learning and behaviors
are the result of certain environmental stimuli; the cognitive processes
that support them are unknown and unstudiable *– *and are therefore
irrelevant. Behavioral therapy came about when behaviorists first
realized that they could use the techniques they had developed for
specific scientific research in order to change maladaptive behaviors,
which are considered the cause of mental disorders. This form of therapy
remains popular in certain areas of psychopathology, where many of the
diagnoses relate to client behaviors. This unit will review the basic
theories of behaviorism and discuss how practitioners apply these
theories in order to treat mental disorders.*
