**Unit 2: Psychoanalytic Therapy** <span id="2"></span> 
*How many films and TV shows have you seen that present the image of an
individual lying on a couch, talking to his therapist about his dreams
and the influence of his mother? Thanks to its prominent place in pop
culture, this form of therapy *– *psychoanalytic therapy *– *is perhaps
the best-known in contemporary society. Though the principles of
psychoanalysis were first developed over 100 years ago and are
attributed to the legendary and highly controversial figure of Sigmund
Freud, psychologists continue to draw from them today. Psychoanalytics
were the first practitioners to attempt to explain mental disorders and
design specific therapies in order to treat patients. This unit will
introduce you to the principles of psychoanalysis and psychoanalytic
therapy, discussing many of Freud’s findings, which, though hotly
contested, remain influential.*
