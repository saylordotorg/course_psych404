**Unit 6: Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy** <span id="6"></span> 
*Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is one of the more recent and
frequently used therapy styles. It combines important findings from
cognitive and behavioral research and uses it to diagnose and treat
patients. As noted above, behavioral therapy focuses on observable
behaviors while ignoring cognitions; cognitive theory, on the other
hand, understands cognitions as the basis for behavior. Accordingly, CBT
attempts to change both the maladaptive cognitions and maladaptive
behaviors, as both may contribute simultaneously to a patient’s problem.
CBT is also highly scientific in its approach, drawing from the
significant research that both behaviorist and cognitive psychology
fields have produced in order to justifying its therapeutic techniques.
In this unit, we will learn the basics of CBT, learning how the approach
makes use of cognitive and behavioral principles and identifying the
techniques it frequently deploys.*
