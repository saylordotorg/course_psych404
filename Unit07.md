**Unit 7: Family Systems Therapy** <span id="7"></span> 
*This final unit will focus on a less common but new and interesting
approach known as family therapy. As the name implies, family therapy is
based on the assumption that in order to change an individual’s
behavior, you must target the different relationships and roles found in
the patient’s family. Rather than focusing on the individual, therapists
focus on problems within the family system and system interactions. The
therapy acknowledges the fact that the family unit is important to
psychological well-being. In fact, researchers have found that certain
aspects of family life contribute to patient relapse and treatment
success. In this unit, we will take a look at how this therapy targets
different aspects of the family structure and identify the theories that
support its treatment techniques.*
